# TeamDynamixLib
Library of TeamDynamix function calls to make my life easier.

Uses RestSharp and Newtonsoft's JSON nuget packages.

You will need TeamDynamix's API Library for these functions to work. You can obtain these in TDNext > Downloads > TeamDynamix API .DLL (.NET 4.5.2) 

I will continue to update this project as time permits.

#### To build the project
> dotnet build
